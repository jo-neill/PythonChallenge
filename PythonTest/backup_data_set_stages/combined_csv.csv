The site is occupied by a one-story-over-garage, single-family residence (built in 1900) and a vacant lot, each of which span both lots. The residential building fronts Cayuga Avenue; the vacant lot fronts Alemany Boulevard, Cayuga and Sickles avenues.The proposed project would demolish the existing residence and construct four new buildings with a total of seven residential units and 1,283 square feet of ground-floor commercial space. On lot 001, the proposed project would construct two new four-story, mixed-use buildings, each consisting of two dwelling units over an approximately 450-square-foot ground-floor commercial space. On Lot 034, the proposed project would construct two new buildings: one four-story mixed-use building with two dwelling units over an approximately 370-square-foot ground floor commercial space; and one four-story single-family residence. The new buildings would front both Cayuga and Sickles avenues.The project would also provide five vehicle parking spaces and eight class 1 bicycle parking spaces within individual garages attached to each of the mixed-use buildings as well as six class 2 bicycles on the Cayuga and Sickles avenues sidewalks. The garages would be accessed from the rear of the proposed buildings via an existing approximately 12-foot-wide curb cut on Cayuga Avenue. The proposed streetscape would include a new sidewalk bulbout at the intersection of Alemany Boulevard and Sickles Avenue and four new street trees (two on Alemany Boulevard and two on Cayuga Avenue).",GPANTOJA,Planning,,,,3101 ALEMANY BLVD 94112,2214 Cayuga Ave. & 3101 Alemany Blvd.

The residential building fronts Cayuga Avenue; the vacant lot fronts Alemany Boulevard, Cayuga and Sickles avenues.The proposed project would demolish the existing residence and construct four new buildings with a total of seven residential units and 1,283 square feet of ground-floor commercial space. On lot 001, the proposed project would construct two new four-story, mixed-use buildings, each consisting of two dwelling units over an approximately 450-square-foot ground-floor commercial space. On Lot 034, the proposed project would construct two new buildings: one four-story mixed-use building with two dwelling units over an approximately 370-square-foot ground floor commercial space; and one four-story single-family residence. The new buildings would front both Cayuga and Sickles avenues.The project would also provide five vehicle parking spaces and eight class 1 bicycle parking spaces within individual garages attached to each of the mixed-use buildings as well as six class 2 bicycles on the Cayuga and Sickles avenues sidewalks. The garages would be accessed from the rear of the proposed buildings via an existing approximately 12-foot-wide curb cut on Cayuga Avenue. The proposed streetscape would include a new sidewalk bulbout at the intersection of Alemany Boulevard and Sickles Avenue and four new street trees (two on Alemany Boulevard and two on Cayuga Avenue).",GPANTOJA,Planning,,,,3101 ALEMANY BLVD 94112,2214 Cayuga Ave. & 3101 Alemany Blvd.
