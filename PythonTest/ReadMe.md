PythonTest Challenge

Description 
This project uses the pandas library to reformat a large group of csv data and assign a relevancy score based on information given in the challenge email. This dataset is then used to train a linear regression model to predict the relevance of any particular project for our client. Details on why linear regression was chosen and how everything works are outlined in the comments of the two .py files. It was developed on Windows, but should run on any operating system.

Getting Started
To run this project first make sure all prerequisites outlined below are met. Then, run the MLScript.py script. The ExcelToCSV.vbs file can be used as an Excel macro to convert multiple Excel files into a single CSV file if needed, but I have already created separate CSV files for each of the sheets I was given and put them in the original_csvs folder.

Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Required packages (see below) installed

Required packages
