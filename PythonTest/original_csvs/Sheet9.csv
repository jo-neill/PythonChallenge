The new buildings would front both Cayuga and Sickles avenues.The project would also provide five vehicle parking spaces and eight class 1 bicycle parking spaces within individual garages attached to each of the mixed-use buildings as well as six class 2 bicycles on the Cayuga and Sickles avenues sidewalks. The garages would be accessed from the rear of the proposed buildings via an existing approximately 12-foot-wide curb cut on Cayuga Avenue. The proposed streetscape would include a new sidewalk bulbout at the intersection of Alemany Boulevard and Sickles Avenue and four new street trees (two on Alemany Boulevard and two on Cayuga Avenue).",GPANTOJA,Planning"40,826",2016-002535PRJ,02/24/2016 12:00:00 AM +0000,Under Review,,1060 FOLSOM ST 94103,Project Profile (PRJ),PRJ,Planning,Project,Project,Planning/Project/Project/PRJ,1060 FOLSOM ST,CHANGE OF USE FROM INDUSTRIAL/WAREHOUSE TO ASSEMBLY AND SOCIAL SERVICE USE (DBA ALCHEMY) AND REMOVE THE NOTICE OF VIOLATION COMPLAINT NUMBER 13538_ENF.,EJARDINE,Planning"66,648",2014.0109,01/17/2014 12:00:00 AM +0000,Under Review,,"65 VILLA TR, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94114",Project Profile (PRJ),PRJ,Planning,Project,Project,Planning/Project/Project/PRJ,65 VILLA TR,Mandatory DR case for Reconstruction associated with 2013.1821DV.,,Planning"21,191",2017-008122PRJ,06/28/2017 12:00:00 AM +0000,Under Review,,101 POST ST 94108,Project Profile (PRJ),PRJ,Planning,Project,Project,Planning/Project/Project/PRJ,101 POST ST,"REPLACE E EXTERIOR FINISHES IN KIND, NEW PAINT AT E PARAPET, LINTLES, SILLS, STUCCO.
